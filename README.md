# 📊 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Description
This project performs customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering** to identify distinct customer groups based on **Annual Income**, **Spending Score**, and **Age**. The goal is to understand customer behavior and support data-driven marketing strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
**Mall Customers Dataset**

**Features:**
- CustomerID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1–100)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior  
- Segment customers into meaningful groups  
- Apply unsupervised machine learning (K-Means)  
- Derive actionable business insights  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection and scaling  
4. K-Means clustering  
5. Cluster labeling  
6. Visualization of clusters  
7. Business interpretation  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- High-income, high-spending customers represent premium customers  
- Young customers with low income but high spending show impulsive behavior  
- High-income but low-spending customers are conservative buyers  
- Low-income, low-spending customers contribute least to revenue  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
K-Means clustering successfully identified distinct customer segments based on income, spending behavior, and age. These insights demonstrate how unsupervised learning can support targeted marketing, customer retention, and business decision-making.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
- Apply clustering to real-world transactional datasets  
- Use Silhouette Score for cluster evaluation  
- Create interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
